### `find-comments + create-comment + update-comment`

Hypothetical scenario: When the issue modification of the `watch` label is added, find out whether there is a comment containing `error` created by k, if there is only one, update the comment, if not, add a new comment.

```yml
name: Test

on:
  isssue:
    types: [edited]

jobs:
  do-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event.label.name == 'watch'
    steps:
      - name: find comments
        uses: actions-cool/issues-helper@v1
        id: fcid
        with:
          actions: 'find-comments'
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          issue-number: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
          comment-auth: k
          body-includes: 'error'

      - name: create comment
        if: ${{ steps.fcid.outputs.comments.length == 0 }}
        uses: actions-cool/issues-helper@v1
        with:
          actions: 'create-comment'
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          issue-number: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
          body: 'Some error!'

      - name: update comment
        if: ${{ steps.fcid.outputs.comments.length == 1 }}
        uses: actions-cool/issues-helper@v1
        with:
          actions: 'update-comment'
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          comment-id: ${{ steps.fcid.outputs.comments[0].id }}
          body: 'Some error again!'
          update-mode: 'append'
```

## 🎁 Reference

### token

Need to have the person token with push permission.

- [Personal token application](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
  - Need to check `Full control of private repositories`
- Project add secrets
  - Select settings, select secrets, select `New repository secret`
  - `Name` is the same as in actions
  - `Value` fill in the token just applied by the individual

When the token is not filled in actions or the corresponding secrets are not added to the project, it will default to github-actions <kbd>bot</kbd>. [More](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow).
