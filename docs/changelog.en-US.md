- Version rules
  - Use two-level semantic version, such as v1, v1.1, v2, v2.1
  - v1 represents the initial version
  - The fixes and additions to the v1 version will be released to the v1.1 version
  - When the released v1.x runs stable for a certain period of time, release the advanced v2 version
